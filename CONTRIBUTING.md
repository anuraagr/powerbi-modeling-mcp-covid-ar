# Contributing

This project welcomes contributions and suggestions. Since this is a demonstration repository showcasing what can be built with the [Power BI Modeling MCP Server](https://github.com/microsoft/powerbi-modeling-mcp), contributions typically fall into a few categories:

## Ways to Contribute

- **Documentation improvements** — Clarify explanations, fix typos, improve formatting.
- **New measure ideas** — Suggest additional DAX measures that would strengthen the analytics model.
- **Workflow examples** — Share alternative prompting strategies or MCP workflows you've discovered.
- **Bug reports** — If something in the documentation is incorrect or a linked resource is broken, [open an issue](../../issues).

## For MCP Server Issues

If you've found a bug or want to request a feature in the **Power BI Modeling MCP Server itself**, please file it in the [upstream repository](https://github.com/microsoft/powerbi-modeling-mcp/issues). This repo documents a model built with the MCP server — it doesn't contain the server code.

## Submitting Changes

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b my-improvement`).
3. Make your changes.
4. Commit with a clear message describing what changed and why.
5. Open a pull request against `main`.
